        <h3 style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>What is Programming?</h3>
        <p>
          Programming is giving a computer a set of instructions to solve a problem. 
        </p>
        <p> Just like we give cooking instructions like "Mix the flour and eggs," we use 
          languages like C to tell computers what to do step by step.</p>
        <p>
          Computers understand only machine code (binary: 0s and 1s), which is too complex 
          for humans to write directly. 
        </p>
        <p>Imagine baking a cake. You know you need flour and eggs, but you can‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄúHey oven, make me a cake.‚Äù You need a detailed recipe with exact measurements and steps. Similarly, we use programming languages to write clear instructions for the computer.
A compiler or interpreter then translates our recipe (code) into something the computer can follow, just like a baker turns ingredients into a cake.

    <h3 style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>What is C?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>C is a statically typed, low-level programming language.</li>
        <li>It is known for its efficiency and direct memory manipulation.</li>
        <li>Unlike Python or Java, C has direct access to memory and hardware.</li>
        <li>Every instruction in C must end with a semicolon (<code>;</code>). If you forget it, the compiler will throw an error.</li>
        <li>C is case-sensitive (<code>word ‚â† Word ‚â† WORD</code>).</li>
        <li>Comments can be:
            <ul>
                <li>Single-line: <code>// This is a comment</code></li>
                <li>Multi-line: <code>/* This is a multi-line comment */</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>C has built-in libraries that provide useful functions. You import them using <code>#include</code>.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3 style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>How Programs Run - Operating System</h3>
        <p>
          Programs run by following instructions processed by the computer‚Äôs CPU. The 
          operating system manages resources like memory and processing power, ensuring 
          programs run efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: Think of your computer like a busy kitchen:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>Programs = different recipes being prepared.</p>
          <p>The OS = the head chef managing tasks and resources.</p>
        </ul>

        <p> We interact with a computer via a terminal.</p>
        <ul className="terminal-commands">
          <li><code>ls</code> ‚Äî Lists all files in the current directory.</li>
          <li><code>mkdir foldername</code> ‚Äî Creates a new directory.</li>
          <li><code>cd foldername</code> ‚Äî Changes into a directory.</li>
          <li><code>cd ..</code> ‚Äî Moves up one level.</li>
          <li><code>pwd</code> ‚Äî Shows the current directory path.</li>
          <li><code>cp source destination</code> ‚Äî Copies a file.</li>
          <li><code>mv source destination</code> ‚Äî Moves or renames a file.</li>
          <li><code>rm filename</code> ‚Äî Deletes a file.</li>

        <h3 style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>How Do Computers Store Data?</h3>
        <p>
          Computers store data using electricity‚Äîeither flowing (1) or not (0). These tiny on-off switches are called <b>bits</b>, the smallest unit of data/memory.
        </p>
        <p>
        8 bits = 1 byte. A single bit is like a grain of flour‚Äînot very useful on its own. But when we combine bits, we can store letters, numbers, and more‚Äîjust like combining flour and eggs to make a cake!
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: The letter <b>A</b> in binary is <code>00000</code>, while <b>B</b> is <code>00001</code>.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>Types of Memory</h3>
        <ul>
          <p><b>RAM (Random Access Memory):</b> Short-term memory, like ingredients on a counter while baking.</p>
          <p><b>HDD/SSD (Hard Drive/SSD):</b> Long-term storage, like flour stored in a pantry.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3 style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>Memory in Programs</h3>
        <p>
          We use <b>variables</b> to store data in memory. Each variable occupies a specific amount of memory based on its data type
        </p>
          <p><strong>Memory Addresses:</strong> Each variable is stored at a unique address in memory.</p>
