Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website, which I aim to continuously update.

It features:

About Me Page: An introduction to my background, interests, and professional aspirations.
Projects Page: A showcase of my work, including key projects that demonstrate my skills in cybersecurity and software development.
Resources Page: A collection of my uni notes, LeetCode practice, C code questions and solutions, and simplified theory/concepts for courses I've taken at UNSW.
Articles Page: Insightful write-ups and explorations into topics related to cybersecurity and software engineering.
Journal Page: A timeline of my university journey, highlighting the courses I've taken and everything I've created.

My goal is to provide valuable content and keep my portfolio updated with my latest work and learnings.

I’ve developed this portfolio using the programming knowledge I’ve gained, and as I continue learning about full-stack development, I plan to make it more advanced.
