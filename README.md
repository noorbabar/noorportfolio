### About This Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website represents my journey in **computer science** and **cybersecurity**, showcasing my skills, projects, and growth. It's an evolving project that I’ve built from the ground up using a combination of **self taught knowledge** and insights gained throughout my **CS degree**.

While the portfolio is still in its early stages, I’m continuously enhancing it with more advanced features!

This portfolio is a reflection of my **self-driven** learning journey. It may appear simple at the moment, but it serves as the foundation of my technical development. As I continue to learn and grow, so will this portfolio!
